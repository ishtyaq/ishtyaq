# Ishtyaq Ahmad

Hi there! I'm Ishtyaq. 

I’m a Solution Architect / Technical Lead working at the intersection of low-code, architecture, and real-world enterprise systems.

I spend most of my time designing and building systems using Mendix, Java, and integrations — focusing on clean architecture, maintainability, and doing low-code the right way (not just fast).

I enjoy breaking down complex problems, questioning default patterns, and borrowing proven ideas from traditional software engineering to improve low-code solutions.

Current interests
- Mendix internals, runtime & monitoring
- Secure integrations (JWT, APIs, middleware)
- System design & architecture principles
- Bridging low-code with pro-code

I believe good systems are simple, observable, and boring in production.
